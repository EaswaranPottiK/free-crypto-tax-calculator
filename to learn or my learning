learn vite and tailwing installation comments
learn basic or vite and why is it better than normal create react app

tailwind - outline-none to prevent focus on input text (after clicking)

conditional rendering - here classes like rounded-xl is applied and also a condition is used 
className={`rounded-xl pr-7 pl-3 py-3 border ${investmentType >0 ?"bg-red-400":""}`}
now this looks complex to avoid these issues can can declare a vaiable and then use it 
const rating = ra >1 ? "one":"two"
